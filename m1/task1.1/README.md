## 1.1.1 Results of my work with Git

I've created private repository on Github which will include results of all future tasks. The next step was setup git global config and clone repository to the local machine. After some preparations I've made initial commit.

Next, I've created three different branches, each contains different versions of index.html and tried to merge it, but there was a merge conflict. After resolving conflict I've merged "develop" into "master"
